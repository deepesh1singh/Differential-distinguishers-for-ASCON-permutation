Differential Distinguishers for ASCON Permutation — Deep Learning Experiments

This repository contains a full set of experiments for training machine-learning-based differential distinguishers targeting the ASCON permutation, a lightweight cryptographic primitive used in authenticated encryption and hashing.
Each experiment is organized by round-reduced versions of ASCON (from 1 to 5 rounds) and implemented via Jupyter notebooks.

The project uses CNN and LSTM neural-network models to classify differential traces, evaluate distinguisher accuracy, and explore the behavior of neural models under increasing ASCON round complexity.
